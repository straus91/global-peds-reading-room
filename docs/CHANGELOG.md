ChangelogAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.The format is based on Keep a Changelog.[Unreleased] - Frontend UI Enhancements & Deferred FeaturesAddedSide-by-Side Layout for Case List Page: "Case Grid View" and "Case List View" (table) are now displayed in a two-column, side-by-side layout on desktop screens, stacking vertically on smaller screens.Side-by-Side Layout for Case Viewer Page: "Imaging" column (with DICOM viewer) and "Case Information" column are now displayed in a two-column, side-by-side layout on desktop screens, stacking vertically on smaller screens.Tabbed Interface for Case Information Column (Case Viewer Page): After a user submits a report, the right-hand "Case Information" column displays content in tabs: "Your Submitted Report" (default active after submission), "AI Feedback", and "Expert Report". Implemented JavaScript logic for tab switching.Structured Top/Bottom Strips in Case Information Column: Top strip now consistently displays Case ID, patient demographics, clinical history, and prominently highlighted Expert Diagnosis (Case.diagnosis). Bottom strip displays references.ChangedCSS (styles.css): Major refactoring to implement the side-by-side layouts for Case List and Case Viewer pages. Implemented robust height and overflow management to ensure the Case Viewer's right-hand "Case Information" column (specifically its tab content area) scrolls independently, preventing global page scrollbars and elongation of the DICOM viewer column. Added styles for the new tabbed interface in the Case Viewer.Footer: Simplified HTML structure for the footer across index.html and all admin pages (dashboard.html, manage-cases.html, add-case.html, manage-users.html, manage-templates.html, settings.html). Updated CSS to make the footer more compact, displaying only "Home" and a contact email.JavaScript (main.js):renderCaseDetail(): Heavily modified to generate the new HTML structure for the Case Viewer page, including the top/bottom strips and the tab container.loadCaseList(): Modified to generate the HTML structure for the side-by-side Case List page.Added setupInfoTabs() function to manage tab switching logic.Updated viewCase() to correctly show/hide the report submission form vs. the new tabbed review container.Updated displayUserSubmittedReport() to target the correct div within the "Your Submitted Report" tab.Updated requestAIFeedback() to target the correct div within the "AI Feedback" tab.FixedCase Viewer Page Scrolling: Addressed issues where long text in the right-hand "Case Information" column would elongate the entire page and the DICOM viewer. The right column's tabbed content now scrolls independently.Stray HTML Comments: Removed `` comments from JavaScript-generated HTML in renderCaseDetail.Admin Page Footers: Ensured admin pages now use the simplified footer structure.[0.1.0] - 2025-05-20 - Initial Release Candidate & Backend EnhancementsAddedEnhanced AI-Powered Feedback Backend:Case model: Added patient_sex field.CaseTemplateSectionContent model: Added key_concepts_text field for admins to define case-specific, section-linked key concepts for expert reports, used to guide AI.llm_feedback_service.py: get_feedback_from_llm signature updated to accept comprehensive case context (case_identifier, demographics, full expert summaries from Case model: key_findings, diagnosis, discussion, and difficulty). LLM prompt significantly enhanced to utilize all new context, incorporate programmatic pre-analysis, request "Critical" or "Moderate" severity levels with justifications for discrepancies, and to ignore minor stylistic differences.cases/utils.py: Added generate_report_comparison_summary function to programmatically compare user vs. expert reports (textual diff per section, check for admin-defined key_concepts_text in user sections, and compare user impression against Case.diagnosis).AIReportFeedbackView (cases/views.py): Now gathers all new case context, calls generate_report_comparison_summary and feeds its output into the LLM prompt. Passes all comprehensive context to get_feedback_from_llm. Includes a _parse_llm_feedback_text method to attempt structuring the LLM's text output into JSON (overall alignment, section-by-section feedback with severity/justification, key learning points). API response for AI feedback (/api/cases/reports/<report_id>/ai-feedback/) now includes raw_llm_feedback and structured_feedback.Case Identification & Admin Workflow:Case model: Added case_identifier field (e.g., SUB-MOD-YYYY-NNNN), auto-generated in save() method, unique, and human-readable. Case.title becomes primarily for admin internal organization.Admin interfaces (cases/admin.py, frontend/admin/add-case.html, frontend/js/admin-case-edit.js) updated to support patient_sex, display case_identifier, and allow input of key_concepts_text for expert template sections. Help texts updated to guide AI-relevant input.User Feedback on AI Feedback Backend:AIFeedbackRating model created (report_id, user_id, star_rating 1-5, optional comment, rated_at).AIFeedbackRatingSerializer and AIFeedbackRatingCreateView created.API endpoint POST /api/cases/ai-feedback-ratings/ added to save user ratings.DICOM Viewing MVP:Integrated Orthanc's OHIF viewer via an <iframe> in the user-facing case view page (frontend/js/main.js) to display DICOM images.Added orthanc_study_uid field to the Case model (backend/cases/models.py) and relevant serializers (backend/cases/serializers.py) to link application cases to DICOM studies in an Orthanc server.Updated the admin case creation/editing form (frontend/admin/add-case.html, frontend/js/admin-case-edit.js) to allow administrators to input the orthanc_study_uid.Initial AI Report Feedback (Google Gemini) MVP:Implemented backend infrastructure for AI-powered feedback on user-submitted radiology reports.Created llm_feedback_service.py in the cases app to handle interaction with the Google Gemini API.Developed a new API endpoint (/api/cases/reports/<report_id>/ai-feedback/) and AIReportFeedbackView to trigger feedback generation.Added google-generativeai and python-dotenv to Python dependencies (backend/requirements.txt).Configured secure API key handling for Gemini using an .env file (backend/.env, loaded by backend/globalpeds_project/settings.py).Developed an initial focused prompt for the Gemini LLM to provide concise, discrepancy-focused feedback comparing user reports to expert reports.Added frontend UI elements (button and display area) in the user case view (frontend/js/main.js) to request and display AI-generated feedback.User Experience Enhancements (Initial):Implemented display of a user's own submitted report on the case view page, allowing for direct comparison with expert analysis and AI feedback (frontend/js/main.js).Standardized Section Naming/Order: Confirmed that MasterTemplateSection.name and .order are the source of truth. Operational guideline: Avoid changing active MasterTemplate structures.Learning Resources (Backend Support): Ensured Case.references field is available via CaseSerializer for frontend display.ChangedAdmin Interface (cases/admin.py): Updated list_display, filters, search fields, and inlines for CaseAdmin, CaseTemplateAdmin, CaseTemplateSectionContentAdmin to reflect new model fields and improve usability.Serializers (cases/serializers.py): CaseSerializer, CaseListSerializer, AdminCaseListSerializer updated for case_identifier and patient_sex. CaseTemplateSectionContentSerializer and CaseTemplateSectionContentUpdateSerializer (within BulkCaseTemplateSectionContentUpdateSerializer) updated to handle key_concepts_text.LLM Prompt: Major revisions to be more structured, accept more context, and request specific output formats (severity, justifications).Admin Case Management Flow: Language version handling now auto-saves case as draft first.FixedAuthentication & Navigation: Corrected admin and user login redirection paths in frontend/js/auth.js to prevent "double frontend" URL errors. Fixed path duplication issue in frontend navigation.Admin Case Management: Resolved issues in the "Add Language Version" flow on the "Add/Edit Case" page (frontend/js/admin-case-edit.js): Ensured case draft save completes successfully (and currentCaseId is available) before attempting to add language versions for new cases. Corrected display of language names in the "Available Languages" dropdown modal.LLM Integration & Configuration: Ensured python-dotenv is correctly installed and configured to load the GEMINI_API_KEY from backend/.env at Django startup, resolving API key availability issues (backend/globalpeds_project/settings.py, backend/cases/llm_feedback_service.py). Corrected a NameError in backend/cases/llm_feedback_service.py by properly defining expert_key_findings_str before its use in the LLM prompt. Updated the Gemini model name used in llm_feedback_service.py to a generally available and supported version (gemini-1.5-flash-latest) to resolve API errors.Miscellaneous Past Fixes: Addressed Patient Age and Key Findings saving issues in the admin interface. Improved Modality and Subspecialty abbreviation handling. Enhanced API data handling for loadMyReports to support both paginated and direct array responses. Resolved potential multiple event listener registration issues. General path consistency improvements across the application. Fixed Manage Cases table action button alignment and display. Corrected Admin Users action button handlers (edit, delete, status toggle). Ensured backend allows DELETE operations for users via the API. Case creation form submission to handle draft saving properly. Frontend case view button functionality.Database Migrations: Fixed issues related to adding unique=True field case_identifier by setting null=True and relying on save() method for population.Backend Imports: Fixed previous NameError issues in admin.py, serializers.py, and views.py related to missing models or PatientSexChoices imports.
